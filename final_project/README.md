This interactive p5.js sketch creates a dynamic audio visualizer that responds to the amplitude of a playing song. It features a rotating ring of reactive rectangles, free-floating particles, and a glowing cursor effect that activates on mouse hover. All visuals pulse and animate in real-time with the music, creating an immersive and vibrant experience.
