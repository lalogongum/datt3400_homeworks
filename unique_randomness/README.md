I used a dataset of 100 random numbers ranging from 1 to 200, which I generated in Java. I chose random numbers because they are simple yet create interesting and unpredictable visuals when used in creative coding. The numbers were saved in a CSV file for easy use in my p5.js code. The code reads these numbers and uses each value to draw moving sine waves. Each wave fades out after a set time, and the lifetime of the waves increases and decreases as the program runs, creating a dynamic effect.
